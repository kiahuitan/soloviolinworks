<div id="Difficulty">
    
    <h3>Difficulty</h3>    
    
    <b>1 = Easiest</b>: comparable to orchestral/chamber parts that advanced players might sight-read or prepare easily
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2 = Easier</b>: comparable to trickier orchestral excerpts or technically easier concertos/sonatas
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>3 = Moderate</b>: comparable to standard 19th/20th-century violin concertos
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>4 = Harder</b>: comparable to Paganini Caprices or Bartok Solo Sonata
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>5 = Hardest</b>: comparable to Heinrich Ernst (virtuosity), Brian Ferneyhough (new complexity), Ben Johnston (microtonality) or Helmut Lachenmann (instrumental concrete)
