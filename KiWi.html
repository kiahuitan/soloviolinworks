    <strong>Hello from "KiWi" (Kia-Hui)! Welcome to my "KiWipedia" of Unaccompanied Solo Violin Works, a free online resource on the vast but mostly unfamiliar unaccompanied repertoire that you (or your student) might perform during COVID-19</strong> <small> (thus I am making this website public prior to its completion with all its intended features - check back often as this website is still under construction).</small> <br> <br>
    
    <strong>I created "KiWipedia" to help every unaccompanied violinist (including myself and my students) conveniently select specific or contrasting repertoire for a balanced or themed program (featuring a particular historical period, geographic region, ethnic/gender identity or any combination thereof) within a certain time limit (such as 1-hour recital or 5-minute encore), expedited by recommendations "KiWi" Selects, difficulty ratings and "soloviolinworks.com" playlists on "Unaccompanied Solo Violin Works" YouTube channel.</strong> Sample scores (of ending) and recordings (of beginning) of each work are provided where available under fair use for nonprofit educational purposes only - please obtain your own sheet music and/or recordings for more in-depth study. <br> <br>
    
   Every effort is being made for "KiWipedia" to be a comprehensive listing of all unaccompanied violin repertoire composed between 1720-2020 (from Bach to pre-COVID-19), though older works that newly came to light and newer works hot off the press are included where known. <small>Please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you notice errors which you would edit or omissions which you would add. Physical access to music scores (from libraries and even my own office) has been temporarily halted due to COVID-19, therefore if you have ready access to a score that is without its ideal sample score link with the ending shown, I would appreciate an electronic copy that I can process and upload (at least until "KiWipedia" becomes a wiki which is not in my plans for the near future).</small> <br>

    Every effort is being made for "KiWipedia" to be a comprehensive listing of all unaccompanied violin repertoire composed between 1720-2020 (from Bach to pre-COVID-19), though older works that newly came to light and newer works hot off the press are included where known. <strong>Please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> with listing details and a perusal score if possible</strong> <small>(it will not be shared/uploaded without your expressed consent)</small> to rectify any unintended omission or error. <br> <br>
    
    <strong>No copyright infringement or loss of sales is intended - on the contrary, my objective is to promote your music to players and audiences alike!</strong> <br>
    <small>No score of any complete work/movement has been uploaded by me from a hard copy; complete scores are linked only when available for free on public domain sites, the composer's personal website or with expressed consent by the composer. No recording has been uploaded by me from a commercial recording; only sample or complete tracks that are readily accessible for free online are linked.</small> <br> <br>
    
    I intend to provide on "KiWipedia" sample recordings of all unaccompanied violin repertoire without existing recordings via my YouTube channel "Unaccompanied Solo Violin Works". Being mindful of copyright, I plan to start with works by composers who agree to have their solo violin work played and posted on YouTube for our mutual benefit without any monetary exchange. <strong>Please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you would give me your blessing so that I might prioritize learning and recording your work; conversely, if I have listed your work as "Tan forthcoming" but you already or will soon have a recording (could be non-commercial) that you are willing to make (at least an excerpt) freely available to the public, please also <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> so that I might upload your link/recording and focus my practice on other works to record.</strong>

    "KiWipedia" is a product of my life's work begun during my conservatory studies (1992-1996 BMusHons Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London UK; 1996-2001 MM/DMA Cleveland Institute of Music, Ohio USA) and continued over two decades of research/creative activity as faculty at American research I institutions (2000-2005 Cornell University; 2005-present The Ohio State University). <strong>MAY NOT BE COPIED, REPRODUCED, TRANSLATED, TRANSMITTED OR STORED IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION - may not be used to add or enhance entries on Wikipedia and its derivatives (such as "List of solo violin pieces" or "Category:Solo violin pieces") in any language or other similar lists (such as "unaccompanied violin repertoire") whether in print, online or via any other format</strong>. I am providing "KiWipedia" as a free online resource so that you may visit soloviolinworks.com as often as you like! Feel free to refer others to soloviolinworks.com; do cite/credit soloviolinworks.com where appropriate. <br> <br>
    
    
    The timely publication of "KiWipedia" during COVID-19 when unaccompanied repertoire is particularly relevant is purely coincidental <small>(except that the pandemic has actually pushed up KiWipedia's initial release by a whole year, albeit not yet with all its planned features since I am still in the early stages of my 2020-21 sabbatical year project).</small> <strong>If you find "KiWipedia" useful or you simply enjoy listening to "soloviolinworks.com" playlists on its accompanying YouTube channel "Unaccompanied Solo Violin Works", please consider supporting musicians</strong> by purchasing their concert tickets and/or commercial recordings. If you feel compelled to donate in appreciation of my labor of love contribution to the music and teaching professions, please donate instead to classical music performers most affected by COVID-19 such as musicians in your local symphony orchestra (see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/818539328/how-fans-can-support-artists-and-music-industry-workers-during-the-outbreak" target="_blank">"How Fans Can Support Artists And Music-Industry Workers During The Outbreak" on npr.org</a>). <br> <br>
    
    <strong>Do <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you would offer to host/sponsor online/live performances/recordings or provide related technological services/support</strong> as I plan to learn/perform/record all unaccompanied violin repertoire without existing recordings in the coming months and years. <small>For example, which affordable camcorder/microphone has the best sound for classical violin and how to connect/sync between recording equipment and computer? Which hardware/software compatible with MacBook would you recommend I purchase and learn how to use? How to edit/optimize audio so that my YouTube videos would more accurately reflect my tone quality? <br> <br>
    
    I am also seeking assistance with website development since I crash learnt very basic coding to create this website as quickly as possible during my COVID-19 summer - I am desperate for more alone time with my violin and less contact time with electronic devices! Ironically, please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">email me</a> if you would volunteer to improve website design/function/social media presence via github, or at least provide straighforward directions that I might follow - any tech geeks out there willing to help out this violin geek remotely? </small> <br> <br>
