	In this <strong>COVID-19 "Back to School" edition</strong>, YouTube video by any player (including students) is often favored over professional audio recording for your inspiration. Sample score of ending/beginning of each work is provided where available/permissible. <a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> links for quick browsing do not replace obtaining your own sheet music or studying the interpretations of great artists via multiple resources. Links to major US distributors/publishers (or organizations that ship worldwide) are for your convenience and reference only; check with your local music store for faster delivery or better pricing. Scores not available for purchase may be borrowed via WorldCat or Australian/Canadian Music Centres though these services are presently limited due to COVID-19 pandemic. Shipping times are also affected but publishers/composers are increasing the availability of digital scores by the day (please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact</a> me to add links that I have missed).

	<a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> is a product of my life's work that spanned from pre-college through doctoral studies followed by two decades of research/creative activity as faculty at American research I institutions. A more comprehensive research edition of <a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> is in progress but do <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact</a> me to fix any glaring error/omission in this condensed <strong>COVID-19 "Back to School" edition</strong>,  hastily published to be useful for the 2020-2021 concert season amidst the pandemic.

    While researching repertoire I could perform unaccompanied (whether by choice or necessity) over my career spanning two to three decades, I had no idea that <a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> would suddenly be of particular relevance in a pandemic. My entire summer in voluntary isolation has been devoted to rushing out this free online resource in time for the fall concert season, thus if you find this condensed <strong>COVID-19 "Back-to-School" edition</strong> useful or you simply enjoy listening to

	playlists, please consider supporting musicians by purchasing their concert tickets and/or commercial recordings. If you feel compelled to donate in appreciation of my labor of love contribution to the music and teaching professions, please donate instead to classical music performers most affected by COVID-19 such as musicians in your local symphony orchestra (see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/818539328/how-fans-can-support-artists-and-music-industry-workers-during-the-outbreak" target="_blank">"How Fans Can Support Artists And Music-Industry Workers During The Outbreak" on npr.org</a>).

    <strong>Do <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact</a> me if you would offer to host/sponsor online/live performances/recordings or provide related technological services/support</strong> as I plan to learn/perform/record all unaccompanied violin repertoire without existing recordings in the coming months and years. <small>For example, which affordable camcorder/microphone has the best sound for classical violin and how to connect/sync between recording equipment and computer? Which hardware/software compatible with MacBook to purchase and learn how to use? How to edit/optimize audio so that YouTube videos would more accurately reflect tone quality?
	
	<br>
	<br>
    
    I am also seeking assistance with website development since I crash learnt very basic coding to create this website as quickly as possible during my COVID-19 summer - I am desperate for more alone time with my violin and less contact time with electronic devices! Ironically, please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">email</a> me if you would volunteer to improve website design/function/social media presence via github, or at least provide straighforward directions that I might follow - any tech geeks out there willing to help out this violin geek remotely? </small>

		Compiling a comprehensive list of unaccompanied solo violin repertoire (for further study) is more complicated than one might expect. In most search engines and catalogs,  "solo violin" results in too many hits (from student volumes with piano accompaniment to concertos and ensemble works with violin obbligato) while "unaccompanied violin" results in two few hits (since relevant works are usually subtitled "for solo violin" or cataloged under "violin" without specifying "unaccompanied").
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
		The advent of internet and self-publishing means existing repertoire my be listed neither in WorldCat nor publisher's catalogs, even if the score is available to the public (i.e. not under restricted copyright such as a commission reserved for a specific performer). Moreover, published listings on recent catalogs may already be unavailable (or very difficult to find) while libraries may liquidate holdings (some scores I had purchased at library sales or borrowed previously are no longer held at any WorldCat library!)
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
		While any recent performance or recording implies that a score most likely exists, it can be difficult to determine its availability to the public at large. Conversely, one may read about the existence of a work yet cannot find either score or recording for verification or study. I may be satisfied enough to locate an archived score requiring special permission to access, but is it of any practical use in an unknown personal collection like my own? What about that recording owned by a colleague that I love but can no longer purchase or find elsewhere?
	
	</small>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	During COVID-19 pandemic, violinists seeking additional unaccompanied repertoire to perform alone can no longer browse the shelves of their local library or music store, thus I rushed to publish this <strong>COVID-19 "Back-to-School" edition</strong> of <a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> prior to the fall concert season. This condensed edition includes only works where both score and recording are available (for purchase/loan/hire) as of July 2020; its short preparation time means there are obvious gaps and possibly errors, particularly in newer areas of study such as diversity inclusion. A more comprehensive research edition of <a class="KiWipedia">KiWipedia</a> is in progress, please <a href="mailto:kiahuitan@soloviolinworks.com" target="_blank">contact</a> me if you have expertise for joint collaboration or inter-disciplinary research (I can think of many possibilities to examine or reflect COVID-19 implications and diversity inclusion via this repertoire) - I am primarily a violinist performer (DMA), not a musicologist!
